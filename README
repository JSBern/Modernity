A Modern Menu for the MATE Desktop Environment based upon the Cardapio menu.



Usage
=====

To use as a MATE panel applet, simply add it as usual: Right-click the panel,
select "Add to panel", then choose "Modernity".

To use as a launcher, run cardapio with the argument 'hidden'. That is:
$ cardapio hidden 

That's it!


Once cardapio is running, you can access it using Super+Space. To change this
key binding and to access many more options, simply change the file at
~/.config/Cardapio/config.ini which is created automatically when Cardapio
*exits*.


Have fun!
